# Stock Price Prediction

This project predicts stock prices using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. It fetches stock data from Yahoo Finance, preprocesses it, and then builds and trains an LSTM model to predict future stock prices.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Streamlit web application for visualizing stock predictions and interacting with the trained LSTM model.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebook for stock price prediction.
- `src/`: Contains Python scripts for data processing (`data_processing.py`) and model definition (`model.py`).
- `data/`: Folder containing raw stock data.
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python packages for the project.
- `.gitignore`: Ignored files for version control.
